# Software Development Agreement

`Purpose` This template is for the creation of an agreement where a contractor creates software for a customer. This template covers only the _creation_ of the software.

If ongoing support, maintenance or training related to the software will be required, contractor and customer should create an additional service agreement.

`Party 1 Name` Developer

`Party 2 Name` Customer

`Speak` The _Software Development Agreement_ sorts out the most important issues around software development services.

This agreement will:
- {{party advantage}};
- use {{document standard}} rights and obligations for a _Software Development Agreement_;
- describe the delivery of services by {{party 1}} to {{party 2}} on a {{payment calculation}} basis;
- cover work {{people property dealing}};
- {{confidentiality direction}};
- {{privacy and data protection}}; and
- describe the services delivered {{description of services}}.

## Payment calculation

## Payment methods

There are a lot of ways that a contractor can get paid for software development work. Depending on the work, some payment methods might be better than others.

Larger projects tend to benefit from the "milestone" payments approach, which stages payments to manage risk for both parties.

Smaller jobs usually take a "pay some up front and the rest at the end" approach.

## Out of scope work

In software development, it's not at all uncommon for a customer to have new ideas about what they want in the software product after development work has already started. There needs to be way to determine how the Developer gets paid for this work.

## Agreement creation

## Agreement length

Software development is usually:

- work done according to a "work scope" (work description); or
- continuous ad-hoc work.

If you're doing the first kind of work, make sure you have a Work Scope - you can make it part of the Agreement by just mentioning it in the right way.

## Cancellation for convenience

Cancellation for convenience makes sense where software is developed on a continuous basis.

If the services provided under the Agreement are based on a Work Scope, this section should be removed.

## Cancellation if agreement is broken
